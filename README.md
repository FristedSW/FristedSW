## 🚀 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Jeppe Fristed**, a 4th semester student studying *Software Teknologi*. Im Passionate about building, breaking, and understanding software from the ground up. I love diving into code, building systems, and learning how things work under the hood — whether it's low-level C or slick frontend UIs.

I believe in writing clean, efficient code, and I’m always up for a challenge, a new language, or a wild side project.  

> *"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad."*
